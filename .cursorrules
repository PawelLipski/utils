# General
- Don't ever work on Cursor-created worktrees in ~/.cursor/worktrees - don't even create them at all, I don't need them

# Build Guidelines
- Don't check for linting issues
- Never run `bazel clean` - it's very expensive and time-consuming
- Always use `bazel run` not language-specific test runners for supported languages
- Use absolute paths when possible in tool arguments

# Communication
- Don't use `| tail` or `| head` on commands - show full output
- Show all command output live, not truncated

# Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Don't create unnecessary wrapper targets or abstractions
- Never keep whitespace at the end of lines in actual code files, keep just single newline at the end of each file
